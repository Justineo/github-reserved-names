## Existing reserved names

These names are labeled as both *reserved and existing* (by the [new organization page](https://github.com/organizations/new)).

These names have **not** been included in the `reserved-names.json` file because the pages appear as a typical user/organization page.

* https://github.com/bookmarks
* https://github.com/media
* https://github.com/owners
* https://github.com/page
* https://github.com/tasks
* https://github.com/uploads

## Reserved, but page redirects

These names are labeled as *reserved* but you *should not* see them in the address bar because the page automatically redirects.

These names *have been* included in the `reserved-names.json` file.
